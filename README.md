# Data Structures and Algorithms
This is my data structures and algorithms working repo. 
The plan is to understand the fundementals in as many programming languages as I can. 
I'm starting off with C, we will see what happens after that.

## Project Structure
Here's what I got so far and where I'm going:
```
.
├── c
│   ├── arrays
│   │   ├── dynamic_array.c
│   ├── linked_lists
│   ├── stacks
│   ├── queues
│   ├── trees
│   ├── hash_tables
│   └── graphs
└── README.md
```
